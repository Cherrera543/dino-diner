<h1>About Dino Diner</h1>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center">
    Founded in 2019 from the collective collective consciousness of the Fall Semester CIS 400 students of Kansas State University, 
    Dino-Diner is devoted to bringing you the finest in dinosaur-themed dining experiences. 
    Despite the prehistoric nature of our menu, we only use the freshest of ingredients, and no dinosaurs were harmed to bring our delectable fare to you.
